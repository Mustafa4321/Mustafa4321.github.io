                <h3>Dijkstra Algorithm</h3>
                Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You could find the source code through<a href="https://github.com/Mustafa4321/Path-Finding-Visualizer">this link.</a>Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other. It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined.

                <h3>Tutorial</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>start node = green node</li>
                    <li>end node = red node</li>
                    <li>yellow = shortest path</li>
                    <li>blue = visited nodes</li>
                    <li>black = wall</li>
                    <br>
                    This visualization of dijkstra shows the shortest path to the start and end node shown on the grid. Click on any part of the grid to create wall then click the visualize button to start the animation which will go around the wall and spread out until it reaches the end node. Finally showing the shortest path as the yellow nodes.

                <h3>Merge Sort</h3>
                Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You could find the source code through<a href="https://github.com/Mustafa4321/Sorting-Visualizer">this link.</a>Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. Merge sort continuously cuts down a list into multiple sublists until each has only one item, then merges those sublists into a sorted list.

                <h3>Tutorial</h3>
                This visual of merge sort is straight forward the generate graph button gives a new random graph and merge sort to see the vertical bars being sorted from shortest to tallest(smallest to largest values).
